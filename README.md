# Data_analysis_Python
The field of data science combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and computer programming to extract knowledge and insights from data. Gathering, cleaning, and transforming unstructured data into a format that can be analysed and visualised are all part of this process. Data scientists use a variety of techniques and tools to handle and interpret data, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data visualisation software. Data science looks for patterns in data that might aid in decision-making, the development of new opportunities, and process optimisation. This interdisciplinary field encompasses the social sciences, business, and engineering.

# Data Preprocessing
The adjustments made to our data prior to feeding it to the algorithm are referred to as pre-processing. Data preparation is a method for transforming unclean data into clean data sets. In other words, anytime data is acquired from various sources, it is done so in a raw manner that makes analysis impossible.

# Need For Data Preprocessing
1. The format of the data in machine learning projects must be correct in order to get better results from the applied model. For example, the Random Forest algorithm does not tolerate null values, hence null values must be handled from the original raw data set in order to execute the Random Forest algorithm. Some specific Machine Learning models require data in a specific format.

2. Another consideration is that the data set should be organised so that many Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms can run simultaneously and the best one is selected.
